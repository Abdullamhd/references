General Git Information 
---

## List git configuration files 
```git config --list```

## Getting help from Git manual 
Examples : 
- git add -h 
- git commit - 
- git help config 
### Interactive staging (Partaly add files)
- ``` git add --patch ```


## Generic git from Base chapter 
- ``` git status -s ``` # this short list of status of the file 
- ``` git diff ``` ## compare between working dir and staged 
- ``` git diff --staged ``` ## for what you staged so far 
## Check for whitespaces in the project (Important ) - Commit guideline 
- ``` git diff --check ``` 

## Git Commiting the change 
- ``` git commit -v ``` ## used for pass the changes to commit editor so every changes displays clearly 
- ``` git commit -v -a ``` ## Skipping the Staging Area in GIT 

---

## Removing files 

1- First Remove the file from working directory 
2- then run the ``` git rm FileName ``` and it's stage the file removal 
3- commit the removal of the file 

## This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file 


```
git rm --cached README
```

---
## Git log 

### For showing the difference between each commit (Very helpful)
- ```git log -p```

### For showing log for specific branch 
- git log branchname --decorate --oneline

### for showing log in all branches 
- git log --all 
### this option display how many lines added , how many files modified , how many lines removed etc
- git log --stat

## This option will display the summary of commit log
- git log --pretty --oneline

## takes a string and shows only those commits that changed the number of occurrences of that string
- git log -S functionName | SearchString 

## If you specify a directory or file name, you can limit the log output to commits that introduced a change to those files. 
- git log -- path/to/file


## display graph of logs 
- git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

## Show the log by author name 
- ```git log --author "Abdullah" ```

---
## Undoing Things 

### redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the ```--amend``` option  

```bash
git commit --amend 
```

## Unstaging the staged file (this suggestion available when we type git status)

- git restore --staged CONTRIBUTING.md

---

## Unmodifying a Modified File 

- git checkout filename 

## Unmodifying a Modified File with git restore

- git restore CONTRIBUTING.md
- git restore fileame --staged


 ---

 ## working with remote
 ### to display the remote urls :
 - git remote -v 
 ### This will display more information
 - git remote show origin 


 ---
 ## Tagging 
 ### Listing the tags 
 - git tag 
 - git tag -l 
 - git tag -l "seach term"
 ### It's recommended to create Annotated tag 

#### Creating Annotated TAG 
 -  git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
 -  git show v1.4 
 - 
#### Create tag for specifc commit ID 
 -   git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02
#### push tags 
- git push origin --tags
- git push origin v1.5

#### Deleting tag
- git tag -d tagname
####  Delete remote tag
- git push origin --delete v1.0 
---
### Branching & Merging

#### Creating new branch and switching to 
- git checkout -b branchName
- git switch -c newBranch 
##### Return to previously created branch
- git switch - 

##### Delete branch
- ```git branch -d branchName ```

##### to see the last commit in branch 
- ``` git branch -v ``` 
##### To see which branch is merged and which is not 
##### Info : 

1 Trying to delete not merged branch will fail 
2 deleting already merged branch is generally safe .
3 we can pass argmenet such as branch name 

- ``` git branch --merged```
- ``` git branch --no-merged```
- ``` git branch --no-merged master

#### List all branch 
- ``` git branch --all ```
#### list a tracking branch 
- ``` git branch -vv ```
#### Deleting remote branch 
- ``` git push origin --delete branchName ```

---
## Git commit short guideline 
### For seeing nicely formated commit history 
- ``` git log --no-merges ``` 

### Checking the whitespace before commit 
- ``` git diff --check ``` 


#### Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

- More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase will confuse you if you run the
two together.


- Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.
Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
- - Bullet points are okay, too
- - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
- - Use a hanging indent
